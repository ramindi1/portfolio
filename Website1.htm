<P><b> I am a 15 year old girl who's into Music. My hobby is playing the <font color=red> piano </font>. My favourite sport is <font color=red> swimming </font>, I started to do swimming since I was in Grade 1. I have <font color=red> two "annoying" brothers </font> whome I <font color=red> LOVE </font>.  
 
<P><b> Technology enables new ways of <font color=red>learning, communicating, and working collaboratively.</font>

<P><b> Technology helps me to be creative in arts, music, videos and more, we can find <font color=red>plenty of resources</font>. Technology also helps me to be creative by <font color=red>experiment with different media and formats</font>.

<P><b> One of the things that helps me is that Technology can access the information in the <font color=red>quickest possible time</font>, which helps us save time. 

<P><b> Technology helps us children learn how to multitask more effectively. While multitasking never allows you to fully focus on one area, we can learn how to <font color=red>listen and type to take notes</font>, or other multitasking activities that can help us <font color=red>succeed in our future</font>. 

<P><b> Technology has made it a lot easier to <font color=red>bring creative minds than we use too</font>. Technology and creativity has brought new ideas and a path through which <font color=red>people can express themselves</font>.
