<P><b> Technology enables new ways of <font color=red>learning, communicating, and working collaboratively.</font> Technology helps me to be creative in arts, music, videos and more, we can find <font color=red>plenty of resources</font>. Technology also helps me to be creative by <font color=red>experiment with different media and formats</font>.

<P><b> One of the things that helps me is that Technology can access the information in the <font color=red>quickest possible time</font>, which helps us save time.
